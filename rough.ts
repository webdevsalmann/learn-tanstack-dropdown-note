/*
    1. Initially get all the tasks and set in tasksData-[context].
    2. Onclick left sidebar list button 
        a. change taskId
            i. based on that taskId change set displayData
            ii. based on displayData change set display








1> fetching tasks every time user clicks on lists
    => fresh data
    => multiple api / server calls

2> Fetch all the tasks initially
    => manupulate based on taskId
    => Initial server load
    => refetch when user add or remove tasks





NEW APPROACH 
 1. based on taskId get all the tasks
